## Resume Services — Landing Page

This repository contains a single-page static landing site for a resume-writing service. The page is implemented using plain HTML and CSS and includes responsive styles, a hero section, and a features grid with supporting images.

### What I built
- A responsive landing page (single HTML file) that showcases resume writing and career services.
- Clean, componentized CSS (inlined in `index.html`) for layout, typography and badges.
- Hero section with call-to-action buttons and informational badges (rating and stats).
- Features grid describing the main service offerings (ATS-friendly resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn optimization, interview prep).
- Mobile-first responsive breakpoints at 768px and 1024px.

### Files in this folder
- `index.html` — The complete page HTML and inline CSS.


### Tech & assets used
- HTML5 and modern CSS (flexbox + CSS grid).
- Google Fonts: Poppins (loaded via `link` in the head).
- No JavaScript required for the current interactions.

### How to view locally
1. Open the project folder in your file manager.
2. Double-click `index.html` or right-click and choose "Open with" then select your browser.

```

### Notes about the implementation
- The CSS is inlined inside `index.html` to keep the project single-file and easy to move.
- The header contains a logo, navigation links (hidden on small screens) and a primary CTA button.
- The hero includes a headline with an SVG underline, two CTA buttons, and two decorative badges (rating and stats) positioned over the hero image.
- The features section uses a CSS grid to display cards with an image, title, and short description.
- Typography and spacing aim for clarity and visual hierarchy; colors use a primary accent (#FF1744) for CTAs and highlights.
